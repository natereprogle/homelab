These are the manifest files for my [Cobalt](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt) deployment. This is so my wife can download videos for my daughter to watch on an iPad while we travel places. We could always use those sketchy websites or 4kDownloader (Which is sketchy in and of itself), or I can use a trusted, open source, no-ads, trackers, or frills video downloader that I can self host in a matter of seconds in my Kube cluster (Or using the Docker Compose file they already have pre-written). 

I use an AdBlocker, but not one that blocks YouTube Ads, and I'm pretty sure I watch enough Ads on the platform that I'm pretty sure I give them more money by *not* paying for Premium that if I did. It's a no-brainer: Safer for my family (Compared to downloading from sketchy websites), convenient for me, and we still stream the videos when at home, which includes Ads.

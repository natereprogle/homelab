I use k3s at home, and while I am aware that the Nginx Ingress Controller is industry standard, the Traefik controller is pretty nice to me, so that's what I chose to use.

Therefore, all my application ingresses will be here, and they will be in the Traefik format. If you want to use these applications, you're responsible for converting them on your own. Sorry! 😁

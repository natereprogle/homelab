# I had a third server, Ananke, who, in Greek mythology, was the goddess of necessity, compulsion, and inevitability.
# This plays on the fact that I am compulsed to constantly buy crap for my homelab, and that it's innevitable that it will expand.
# I also had a fourth server which is currently dead, which I originally named Hades because it had died once already and randomly came back to life lol. Then it died again without warning :')
# I have no reason to add these comments, it's just a fun fact. I love naming my servers things like this because it's funny to me.

# I've merged many of my workloads into three servers, one of which is a Windows PC that I do not plan on automating as it is not necessary to do so, so it is not listed here.
